This is a basic implementation of the rawg.io API for Salad Technologies.

It implements the API documented at https://www.notion.so/Salad-s-Technical-Interview-bf17810d07994f559121c71260a2085a.

Included in the project is a set of Postman requests that exercise the various APIs.  They can be found in the SaladDemo/Postman Testing folder.  By importing these into Postman, you have a set of ready-made requests for testing and debugging.

The appsettings.json file must have a valid RAWG API key added to it before using this project.
